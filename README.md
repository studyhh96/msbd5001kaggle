# msbd5001kaggle
this is my 5001 kaggle code
this project is about predicting the games' running time
however i got a terrible result
now my best model is linear model, which is better than xgb and lgb those tree structure model and nerual network model
here are some reason that i guess:
1.data cleansing: missing data and the dummies features. The data missing in some important features and the dataset is small, so the way\
to deal with the missing data is important. and the feature like tags,genres, maybe is not suitable to get dummy.
2.perhaps i need to try more models.
